# weather-app
A simple JavaScript weather app built using the freeCodeCamp Weather API.

The app will ask for the user's location, and upon being given permission will display the location, temperature (initially in Celsius), current overall weather conditions (clear, cloudy, etc.), the wind speed, and the humidity. There is also a button to change the temperature to Fahrenheit. 

The styling is very minimalistic, with simple background color animations that change depending on the conditions.
